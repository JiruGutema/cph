The `seen` dictionary plays a crucial role in efficiently managing and tracking the subsequences that alternate between `0` and `1`. It helps ensure that we maintain the alternating pattern in subsequences while minimizing unnecessary computations. Let's break down how it works and how it helps.

### Purpose of `seen` Dictionary:
The dictionary has two keys: `'0'` and `'1'`, each of which stores a list of indices of subsequences that are waiting for the next character to be `'0'` or `'1'`, respectively.

Here’s how it helps:

1. **Tracking Available Subsequences:**
   - When processing the string, if the current character (`char`) is `'0'` or `'1'`, we look at `seen[char]` to check if there’s any subsequence that is ready to accept this character.
   - If there is a subsequence waiting for `'0'` or `'1'`, we use the last available subsequence and add the current character to it.
   - If there isn’t a subsequence ready for the current character, we start a new subsequence and assign it to the opposite character for the next step (because subsequences must alternate).

### How it Works:
1. **`seen[char]` Tracks the Next Expected Character:**
   - The key idea here is that a subsequence will alternate between `0` and `1`. 
   - If we are adding a `1`, the next character in the subsequence should be a `0`, and vice versa.
   - `seen['1']` keeps track of subsequences that expect a `0` next, and `seen['0']` tracks subsequences that expect a `1` next.

2. **When Processing the String:**
   - **If the character (`char`) can be added to an existing subsequence**:
     - The subsequence that is ready for this character (`seen[char]` has an entry) is selected.
     - The current character is added to that subsequence.
     - Then, we update `seen` so that this subsequence now expects the opposite character (because subsequences alternate between `0` and `1`).
   - **If no subsequence can be used**:
     - A new subsequence is created for the current character.
     - The new subsequence is added to the `seen` dictionary with the opposite character as the expected next one.

### Example:

Let's take the string `101010` as an example:

1. **Processing the first character ('1')**:
   - `seen['1']` is empty, so no subsequence can be used for this `1`.
   - A new subsequence is created: `parts = [[1]]`.
   - Now, `seen['0']` needs to expect the next character (which should be `'0'`), so `seen['0'] = [0]`.

2. **Processing the second character ('0')**:
   - `seen['0']` is not empty, so we can use the subsequence that expects `'0'`.
   - Pop the subsequence at index `0` from `seen['0']`, and add this `0` to it: `parts = [[1, 2]]`.
   - Now, this subsequence expects `'1'`, so we append index `0` to `seen['1']`.

3. **Processing the third character ('1')**:
   - `seen['1']` is not empty, so we can use the subsequence that expects `'1'`.
   - Pop the subsequence at index `0` from `seen['1']`, and add this `1` to it: `parts = [[1, 2, 3]]`.
   - Now, this subsequence expects `'0'`, so we append index `0` to `seen['0']`.

4. **Processing the fourth character ('0')**:
   - `seen['0']` is not empty, so we can use the subsequence that expects `'0'`.
   - Pop the subsequence at index `0` from `seen['0']`, and add this `0` to it: `parts = [[1, 2, 3, 4]]`.
   - Now, this subsequence expects `'1'`, so we append index `0` to `seen['1']`.

5. **Processing the fifth character ('1')**:
   - `seen['1']` is not empty, so we can use the subsequence that expects `'1'`.
   - Pop the subsequence at index `0` from `seen['1']`, and add this `1` to it: `parts = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]`.
   - Now, this subsequence expects `'0'`, so we append index `0` to `seen['0']`.

6. **Processing the sixth character ('0')**:
   - `seen['0']` is not empty, so we can use the subsequence that expects `'0'`.
   - Pop the subsequence at index `0` from `seen['0']`, and add this `0` to it: `parts = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]`.
   - Now, this subsequence expects `'1'`, so we append index `0` to `seen['1']`.

### Summary:
- The `seen` dictionary helps track which subsequences are currently available to accept the next character in the alternating pattern.
- By using the `seen` dictionary, the code efficiently manages subsequences and ensures that they alternate between `0` and `1` without needing to scan or check all subsequences repeatedly. This improves performance and keeps the logic concise.a
